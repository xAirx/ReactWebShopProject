#### The devops setup is explained here:

            https://github.com/xAirx/CI-CD-Playground
	    
## Devserver: (Requires LOGIN and password).

                https://webshopproject-development.herokuapp.com/
		
		Command:  heroku run terraform output private_access_password â€”app webshopproject-development


#### Devbranch basic auth (password projected dev branch.

                       Development branch includes a Basic auth setup that locks it down behind username and password.
                       
		       This is done via terraform and kong in combination with a buildpack created for CRA and heroku.
                       

#### Devbranch Sentry Trigger component

                      Development branch also includes functionality to conditionally render a test button component based on an env variable set by the heroku 		      server. on local dotENV is used - the idea here is that I can trigger sentry from dev.
